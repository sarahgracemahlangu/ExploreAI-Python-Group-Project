# ExploreAI-Python-Group-Project

This repository is for the ExploreAI Python group project. The project runs on a python notebook and the code for the project can be found in the main branch of this repository.

# Overview 

The objective for the group project was to perform a *Water Quality Assessment* on the "Contaminated River Water" data (found on Kaggle) where we evaluate the overall quality of the river water by analyzing key parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and the presence of contaminants like heavy metals, etc.
Additionally perform a *Trend Analysis* where we identify trends over time in the water quality data to understand how pollution levels have changed. 

Data source:
river_water_parameters.csv

Importance of study(analysis)
To help determine if the water is safe and healthy for the ecosystem in the rivers
